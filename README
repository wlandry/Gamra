This is Gamra, a 2D/3D code for solid earth modeling.  To build, you
must build and install SAMRAI separately.  You must get it from the
CIG repository, because I have patched it to work with Gamra.

  hg clone http://geodynamics.org/hg/cs/AMR/Samrai/

After building SAMRAI, download the FTensor library

  hg clone http://geodynamics.org/hg/cs/AMR/Samrai/

Gamra uses Waf to configure and build.  The configure, at present,
only looks for a compiler.  So you will have to modify the file

  wscript

to point to where Samrai and FTensor are.  You may also have to change
the linked in libraries depending on how you built SAMRAI.
