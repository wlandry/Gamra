/*!
 * @brief Class for solving scalar Stokes's equation on SAMR grid,
 * wrapping up lower-level components (FAC cycling, Stokes equation
 * operations and boundary conditions) in a single high-level interface.
 *
 * Note: this class provides a backward-compatible interface to
 * the soon-to-be obsolete StokesHierarchySolver<DIM> class.
 * Although this class hides the lower-level components (FAC cycling,
 * Stokes equation operations and boundary conditions), it is
 * perfectly acceptable to use those lower-level components directly.
 *
 * We solve the equation
 *    div(D grad(u)) + Cu = f
 * where D is a side-centered array and C is a cell-centered array.
 * u and f are also cell-centered.
 * Boundary conditions supported are Dirichlet, Neumann and mixed
 * (Dirichlet on some faces and Neumann on others).
 *
 * This class is a wrapper, providing a single class that coordinates
 * three major components: the FAC solver, the cell-centered Stokes
 * FAC operator and a default Robin bc coefficient implelemtation.
 * It is perfectly acceptable to use those classes outside of this
 * class.
 *
 * The underlying solver is an FAC solver using cell-centered
 * discretization.  The difference scheme is second-order
 * central-difference.  On coarse-fine boundaries within the
 * solution levels, the composite grid operator uses, by default,
 * the discretization method of Ewing, Lazarov and Vassilevski
 * ("Local Refinement Techniques for Elliptic Problems on
 * Cell-Centered Grids, I. Error Analysis", Mathematics of
 * Computation, Vol. 56, No. 194, April 1991, pp. 437-461).
 *
 * Typical use of this class is:
 * -# Construct a StokesFACSolver object, providing it
 *    the hierarchy and range of levels participating in the solve.
 * -# Set the parameters C and D using the functions named @c setC...
 *    and @c setD...  By default, D=1 and C=0 everywhere.
 * -# Call setBoundaries() to state the types boundary conditions,
 *    along with supplemental data for setting those boundary
 *    conditions.
 * -# Call initializeSolverState() to set up information
 *    internal to the solver.  This is step is not required
 *    but will save setup costs if you are making multiple
 *    solves.  This commits the object to the current hierarchy state
 *    and the specific @em types of boundary conditions you selected,
 *    It does NOT commit to the specific @em values of the boundary
 *    condition.  A hierarchy change (through adaption or other means)
 *    invalidates the state, thus you must reinitialize or
 *    deallocateSolverState() the state before another solve.
 * -# Solve the equation with solveSystem().  You provide the
 *    patch data indices for the solution u and the right hand
 *    side f.  u must have at least one ghost cell and where
 *    a Dirichlet boundary condition applies, those cells
 *    must be set to the value on the boundary.  If only Neumann
 *    boundary conditions are used, the ghost cell values
 *    do not matter.
 * -# Call deallocateSolverState() to free up internal resources,
 *    if initializeSolverState() was called before the solve.
 *
 * After the solve, information on the solve can be obtained
 * by calling one of these functions:
 * - getNumberOfIterations() gives the number of FAC cycles used.
 * - getConvergenceFactors() gives the average and final convergence
 *   factors for the solve.
 * - getResidualNorm() gives the final residual
 *
 * Finer solver controls can be set using the functions in this class.
 *
 * Object of this class can be set using input databases.
 * The following parameters can be set.  Each is shown with its
 * default value in the case where hypre is used.
 * @verbatim
 * enable_logging = TRUE // Bool flag to switch logging on/off
 * max_cycles = 10       // Integer number of max FAC cycles to use
 * residual_tol = 1.e-6  // Residual tolerance to solve for
 * num_pre_sweeps = 1    // Number of presmoothing sweeps to use
 * num_post_sweeps = 1   // Number of postsmoothing sweeps to use
 * coarse_fine_discretization = "Ewing" // Name of coarse-fine discretization
 * prolongation_method = "CONSTANT_REFINE" // Name of prolongation method
 * coarse_solver_choice = "hypre"  // Name of coarse level solver
 * coarse_solver_tolerance = 1e-10 // Coarse level tolerance
 * coarse_solver_max_iterations = 20 // Coarse level max iterations
 * use_smg = "FALSE"     // Whether to use hypre's smg solver
 *                       // (alternative is the pfmg solver)

    * This method is used to set up the default SimpleCellRobinBcCoefs

    * alternatively provide your own implementation of the Robin
    * boundary condition coefficients using the setBcObject() method.
    *
    * The boundary conditions specified as the
    * std::string argument "boundary_type."  The boundary type argument can be
    * "Dirichlet", "Neumann", or "Mixed".
    *
    * If using Dirichlet boundary conditions, then before the solver is
    * called, the storage for the unknown u
    * must have a mapped_box_level of ghost cells at least one cell wide that includes
    * the Dirichlet boundary values.
    *
    * If using Neumann boundary conditions, then before the solver is called,
    * the outerface boundary flux data must be set for the Neumann conditions.
    * The fluxes argument gives the patch data index of this flux
    * data.
    *
    * The mixed boundary type is for a mixture of Dirichlet and Neumann
    * boundary conditions are used at the physical domain boundary.
    * The fluxes argument gives the patch data index of the outerface data
    * that specifies the flux data for the Neumann conditions.  The flags
    * array is an outerface data array of integer flags that specifies whether
    * Dirichlet (flag == zero) or Neumann (flag == one) conditions are to be
    * used at a particular cell boundary face.  Note that the flag data must
    * be set before the matrix entries can be computed and the flux data
    * must be set before the solver is called.  The bdry_types argument can
    * be used if the boundary conditions are mixed but one or more of the
    * faces of the physical boundary are entirely either Dirichlet or
    * Neumann boundaries.  The bdry_types argument should be an array of
    * 2*DIM integers, specifying the boundary conditions on each side of
    * the physical domain.  It should be ordered {x_lo, x_hi, y_lo, y_hi,
    * z_lo, z_hi}, with the values for each face being 0 for Dirichlet
    * conditions, 1 for Neumann conditions, and 2 for mixed boundary

    * it can sometimes make the StokesHYPRESolver class more efficient.
